										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Topic:</strong> How we have increased our outreach through BizLab’s Twitter account</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello and welcome to my first blog on the BizLab site! My name is Brian Kelley and I <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/0.jpeg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignleft wp-image-1836 size-thumbnail" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/0-150x150.jpeg" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/0-150x150.jpeg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/0.jpeg 184w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>was hired as BizLab’s marketing and promotions summer fellow in early June. I am a Communications major and will be going into my senior year at <a href="https://www.merrimack.edu/">Merrimack College</a> beginning in September. Since I was hired, I have been observing and learning about the media industry through my experiences and interactions with BizLab. In this blog, I will be discussing the methods and data that have played a role in increasing our social media following on Twitter.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the first things that I did when I was hired was to check the previous activity of the account. The activity of the account was vital to check, as it provided me with a more precise idea of the account’s objectives, previous tweets, and analytics. Our Twitter page, <a href="https://twitter.com/WBURBizLab">@WBURBizLab</a>, was created in October of 2018. As of June 1, we had 231 followers and our tweets had reached 33,200 people. Not a bad number, but something that could be improved upon. In order to discover our strengths and potential areas of improvement, I dove deeper into each individual tweet to find successful trends.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1935" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1935" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://twitter.com/WBURBizLab"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1935" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-30-at-3.25.35-PM.png" alt="" width="516" height="413" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1935" class="wp-caption-text">The homepage of @WBURBizLab on Twitter</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One positive trend that I noticed was when tweets mentioned specific organizations. A January 9th tweet congratulated <a href="http://dcist.com/">DCist</a>, <a href="https://louisvillepublicmedia.org/">LPM</a>, <a href="http://wlrn.org/">WLRN</a>, <a href="http://vpr.org/">VPR</a>, <a href="http://capradio.org/">CapRadio</a>, and <a href="http://wdet.org/">WDET</a> and tagged each of them by using @ and the station. This post generated 1500 views, 11 likes, and 2 retweets. By tagging each station, we increased the likelihood that the message would be seen by individuals who follow the station, but do not yet follow the @WBURBizLab account.</span></p>
<figure id="attachment_1928" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1928" style="width: 453px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-12.57.57-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1928 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-12.57.57-PM-e1564514038912.png" alt="" width="453" height="154" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1928" class="wp-caption-text">A successful Tweet from January 9, 2019 tagged each cohort station</figcaption></figure>
<p>Another key practice was the inclusion of hashtags. In the time prior to me joining BizLab, there was only one tweet that included a hashtag. The January 11th tweet included the hashtag #pubmedia, which is one of the main identifiers used by public media organizations on Twitter. The tweet generated 2,724 views and can be directly tied to an increase of 4 followers.</p>
<figure id="attachment_1930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1930" style="width: 444px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-12.59.13-PM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1930" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-12.59.13-PM.png" alt="" width="444" height="124" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-12.59.13-PM.png 430w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Screen-Shot-2019-07-25-at-12.59.13-PM-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1930" class="wp-caption-text">This post used the hashtag #pubmedia, which is one of the more successful &#8220;impression getters&#8221; for the public media industry</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, I found that tweets that included photos would typically increase impressions and followers for our account. For example, there was a media tweet from March that read “We kicked off our first 2019 station workshop with @DCist/@WAMU885 today. We are spending 3 intense days summarizing research, ideating product offerings, and designing lean tests of our ideas. AKA lots of stickies” generated 3,833 impressions. These 3,833 impressions represented over 90% of BizLab’s total Twitter outreach for the month.</span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/download-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1960 " src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/download-1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="361" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To summarize, I found that tagging accounts, including hashtags, and using media (photo or gif) posts has worked for us in the past. By including these more throughout June and July,</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> our following is up to 284 people from 231, which means that we have increased our follower count by about 23% since June 1. Additionally, we have made roughly 13,800 impressions over the past 61 days, which represents 42% of our total from our account’s inception date through May 31st. Tweets from January-mid June are no longer receiving as many views, but tweets from late June- today are still generating impressions, so the 13,800 generated since June 1 will likely increase in the coming days.</span></p>
