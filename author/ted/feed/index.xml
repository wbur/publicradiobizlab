										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As an analytics professional, part of what attracted me to the work of WBUR’s BizLab for the opportunity to compare analytics across a variety of sites from around the country, each with differing user-bases, use-cases and key features.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we began research efforts with our cohort stations early this year, I reviewed each partner organization&#8217;s analytics data and immediately began to notice distinctive patterns in the time of day when users engaged with each site. BizLab cohort partners included a local event-focused site and a hip local news site, as well as the regional public radio news sites you may be most familiar with. It’s important to keep these divergent content profiles in mind when comparing traffic between sites.</span></p>
<p>Our first two cohort partners managed sites which illustrated the distinctive traffic patterns yielded by two very different types of content. Do502 is an events site offering a guide to shows, food and activities in Louisville and DCist is a news site with an informal tone which offers stories that matter to people who live and/or work in Washington DC.</p>
<p>While DCist sees peaks of mobile traffic during each commute and steady desktop traffic during the workday, Do502 desktop traffic hits its peaks on Monday and Fridays when their events emails are sent out. Also, Do502 mobile activity reaches its peak on Fridays and Saturdays, while DCist mobile activity falls off on the weekends. This is when most events covered by Do502 occur, and meanwhile DCist readers know not to expect to see new content published on weekends.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sparklines-DCist-and-Do502.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2555 size-full aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sparklines-DCist-and-Do502.png" alt="Time of Day Traffic Patterns" width="974" height="504" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sparklines-DCist-and-Do502.png 974w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sparklines-DCist-and-Do502-300x155.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Sparklines-DCist-and-Do502-768x397.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, I identified a few common time-of-day patterns in our cohort analytics data; have a look, then use the final section to compare your own data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">If: Your traffic sees mid-day plateaus during the work-week:</span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then: You provide a steady feed of diverting content which draws your users during their workday.</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Devils-Tower-Pattern.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2575 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Devils-Tower-Pattern.png" alt="" width="600" height="371" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Devils-Tower-Pattern.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Devils-Tower-Pattern-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<figure id="attachment_2573" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2573" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dreyfus.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2573 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dreyfus-300x270.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="270" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dreyfus-300x270.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/dreyfus.jpg 470w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2573" class="wp-caption-text">This is important! This means something!</figcaption></figure>
<ul>
<li>Consider this context as you make editorial decisions, or as you decide how to interpret analytics results.</li>
<li>Google Analytics is not revealing communiqués from Spielbergian extraterrestrials. When your plateau is distinct as it is in the example, it’s likely that you have a localized audience.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-farther-from-DC-the-smoother-the-traffic-pattern-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-2561 size-full aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-farther-from-DC-the-smoother-the-traffic-pattern-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="371" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-farther-from-DC-the-smoother-the-traffic-pattern-1.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/The-farther-from-DC-the-smoother-the-traffic-pattern-1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WBUR-Exhibits-the-Same-Pattern-03.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2558 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WBUR-Exhibits-the-Same-Pattern-03.png" alt="" width="600" height="371" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WBUR-Exhibits-the-Same-Pattern-03.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/WBUR-Exhibits-the-Same-Pattern-03-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">If: Your traffic features distinct peaks:</span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then: Your users are largely choosing to engage with your property at the beginning and close of each day.</span></h2>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cat-Ears-Pattern-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2560 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cat-Ears-Pattern-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="371" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cat-Ears-Pattern-1.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cat-Ears-Pattern-1-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It might be worthwhile to review sessions per user per day to understand whether for your site this pattern indicates that users are coming twice each day, or that there are two cohorts of users who respectively visit in the morning and evening.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To understand what your users are doing during peaks, identify your peak hours and then see what sources of acquisition are strongest during peaks compared to the rest of the day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This pattern could indicate that your site’s engagement is driven by the commute, especially if it’s especially pronounced for your mobile users.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">If: Your weekday traffic exhibits a sharp morning incline, then a slow decline for the rest of the day:</span></h2>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then: Your audience has good reason to check in with you first thing, but you aren’t providing as compelling a reason to return later in the day.</span><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Whale-Pattern.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2562 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Whale-Pattern.png" alt="" width="600" height="371" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Whale-Pattern.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Whale-Pattern-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you see this pattern in your site, consider whether it&#8217;s a strategic priority to attract more users throughout the afternoon. If so:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider regularly publishing some content in the afternoon, so your users can have a reason to return after their morning session.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re sending newsletters in the mornings, check to see how much newsletter traffic is responsible for your morning peak. If its effect is negligible, consider some A/B tests around sending the newsletter in the afternoons instead.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Now you try!</b></h2>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Start by adding this report: </span><a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/template?uid=TtIV35NvQaG2IRNCKFKARA"><b>SessionData Extract|v01</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the Google Analytics instance for the property you’d like to measure. <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Import-Custom-report.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2564 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Import-Custom-report.png" alt="" width="755" height="330" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Import-Custom-report.png 755w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Import-Custom-report-300x131.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 755px) 100vw, 755px" /></a></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set a recent date-range which results in no more than 5,000 rows of data in the report; that should give you plenty of space to extract a full year’s worth of data.<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/set-date-range-in-custom-report.png"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-2565 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/set-date-range-in-custom-report.png" alt="" width="861" height="461" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/set-date-range-in-custom-report.png 861w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/set-date-range-in-custom-report-300x161.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/set-date-range-in-custom-report-768x411.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 861px) 100vw, 861px" /></a></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Set the report to show the maximum 5,000 rows, then export this report to google sheets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Open this template google sheet I’ve built. The template is view-only so <strong>make a copy for yourself </strong>so you can edit. </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dS09d_ajIUdh-R501eJ0gZCh-FiYOpVCwbiBNaXfEWA/edit?usp=sharing"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TEMPLATE &#8211; Time of Day Comparison</span></a><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/template-screenshot.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-2566 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/template-screenshot.png" alt="" width="989" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/template-screenshot.png 989w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/template-screenshot-300x91.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2020/01/template-screenshot-768x233.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 989px) 100vw, 989px" /></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, copy the data from your exported google analytics report into the <strong>TABLE tab</strong> of your copy of the google sheet. The charts on the subsequent tabs will populate with the data you’ve added. Which of the described patterns or BizLab cohort station patterns does your traffic most closely resemble? Take a screenshot and tweet me your results at <a href="https://twitter.com/ted_fuller">@Ted_Fuller</a>!</span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Advanced:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Apply custom segments to the SessionData Extract report to extract data for specific segments, i.e. regions, activities, demographics etc. Then, compare the data you’ve collected!</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Public radio has mastered the art of requesting donations in live audio, but we need to develop a strategy for asynchronous, on-demand audio, which is becoming more and more prevalent &#8211; most visibly through the success of podcasts.</p>
<p>This panel will feature three successful case studies, as well as outline best practices and tips for engaging this unique audience. While we at WBUR have experimented with podcast donation, what impressed us about these panelists is that they’ve figured out the best practices for making the ask.</p>

<h2>Audience Questions</h2>
<p>Our panelists provided written answers to audience questions not covered in the live discussion.</p>
<h4>What/when is a good threshold for admitting you&#8217;ve failed &amp; need to pivot, in terms of both total podcast listens and podcast revenue?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> I think it’s really important to understand why your podcast exists&#8230;if you’ve made something simply in order to make money or getting tons of downloads, that’s not enough. It’s also important to understand that some very small podcasts make a LOT of money, and some very big ones don’t. The most honest answer here is that I would have to know/hear more about the project you are asking about in order to weigh in with a solid opinion!</li>
</ul>
<h4>How do you measure success: downloads, impressions, donations, sponsors?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> We’re still learning what success looks like. Yes, we track downloads, number of donors (and if they are new, renewing, lapsed rejoin, etc), revenue generated from events and other typical measures. But what we are seeing is huge progress in how our teams work together and the trust we are building between different departments that may typically fall into siloed behaviors. We are operating from a place of meeting individual goals to serve the overall mission of getting great, eye-opening content to our listeners and flexible in how to get there. That’s been a huge success that we are tremendously proud of.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> It depends entirely on the content of the podcast. Honestly&#8230;build your success metrics custom for each project you do, because you will make yourself crazy trying to replicate past successes of you don’t take that approach.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How do you communicate the call-to-action? How do you get someone to go from listening to engaging with their device to make the donation?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amira (glow.fm):</strong> Be crystal clear in your call to action about how to give, and then include an easy link in the shownotes to the donation page. In the call to action, it’s helpful to say how easy it is to give: “It’ll take no more than 30 seconds of your time, and 3 taps. We’ll wait here while you go ahead and click on the link in the shownotes or navigate to www.station.org/donate.” We’ve actually seen massive spikes in giving when the hosts emphasize how easy it is to give and articulate the process for doing so. A lot of listeners anticipate a clunky road to donating, so they continuously ‘save it for later.’ Make it easy to give and tell your listeners how easy it is.</li>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> I second what Amira said!</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> Think about the listener and make it AS EASY AS POSSIBLE. Put your donation link in your show notes and tell the listener to look there. ALSO put it on your website. Consider using PayPal, which is a platform most people who’ve ever bought anything on the internet use all the time, whether they know it or not. Think of it like buying a magazine or a pack of gum at the grocery checkout, and create that experience for the listener. Ideally, your listener shouldn’t have to remember to do it later, but should be able to hit pause right then and get it done quickly, without having to fill in a bunch of personal information on a donation form. Email is enough.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When in a podcast&#8217;s life cycle is the best time to start asking listeners for contributions?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> I don’t think it’s ever too early, because it sets the expectation that this content they are enjoying takes time and resources to create. The earliest we’ve asked at this point for actual donations is the second episode, but we will do other asks like asking people to pass on the podcast to two friends, rate and review in their podcast app, or sign up for an email newsletter. We’ve basically taken the typical engagement ladder strategy for on-air and just sped things up. Our digital director likes to say that the time from dating to marriage in podcasts is a lot shorter than with on-air listening, so you could see a higher rate of return if you start your asks earlier.<br />
<strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> It’s never too early, especially if you’re making something you think people will love (which should be everything, right?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can you share some successful marketing techniques to drive listening?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> Our marketing team has seen success using an audience engagement strategy that helps influence the algorithms. We ask listeners to pass on the podcast to friends as well as rate and review in their podcast apps. The team also develops robust social strategy and newsletter content that is easily shareable for listeners to help spread the word. We’ve also seen success with doing swaps with other podcasts in similar content verticals, and being selected for new and noteworthy lists has given us a bump.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> Buy ads/do ad swaps with other podcasts outside of your station (and maybe even outside public radio). This is, hands-down, the best way to drive listening to a show. Ask your podcast teams for ideas on what shows would be a good fit.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How much are you moving podcast supporters into &#8220;regular&#8221; members of your station? Does it work / not work?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> We are still working on refining tracking mechanisms, so we won’t be able to evaluate whether our first robustly tracked group of donors from podcast donations renews until April 2020. But overall, when people give to “podcasts,” they are contributing to unrestricted KUOW funds so they end up in our regular membership pipeline. That means they get stewarded like the rest of our members, although we are hoping to do more customized messaging as we move into a new email marketing system that better links with our donor database.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> My question would be WHY do you want to do this with podcast supporters? Is it good service to push someone who lives in a different state to think of themselves as a member of your station, or is it a better service to have them support the show that connected them to you in the first place? Is the better answer to change your internal thinking around/definition of “membership?” And then to hyper/custom serve the folks who’ve opted in financially with you via that channel? I think so. That being said, at NHPR we do try to identify folks who live within or near our state and have donated to one or more of our podcasts and then communicate with them in a more membership-focused way. We have some work to do on creating systems around that across teams, however, because our opt-in/open rates for podcast email subscribers are very high, and we don’t want to abuse their trust by putting them in a membership funnel without serving them at the same time. One of the ways we’ve worked around this is to maintain those email lists in duplicate on separate sides of the firewall so that a person could, for instance, opt-out of fundraising messaging but still get podcast emails.</li>
</ul>
<h4>For Kjerstin: When your podcast donors get added into the membership funnel do you treat them always as a separate segment or send them general messaging?</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> In an ideal world, they would get a separate messaging stream. Once we have finished transitioning into our email system that aligns better with our donor database, I am hoping to customize messaging streams attached to the campaign codes that we currently use to track funds raised by podcasts. This would still include some education around the larger messaging about our station and how that podcast fits into our overall mission of creating and serving a more informed public. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4>Do you ever see content donation fatigue with so many asks, often at regular intervals?</h4>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;"><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> I have not seen evidence of donation fatigue in our podcasts, and certainly not at the rate in which I receive comments about our on-air solicitations. </span></li>
</ul>
<h4>To the panelists working at public radio stations, does $ raised by a particular podcast go towards that podcast or into the station’s general money pot?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> We are very clear in our messaging that their donations go to support “innovative content like Podcast XYZ.” It is unrestricted fundraising that goes into our general fund.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> Right now, we don’t have a dedicated pot, but we are looking at making a change there &#8211; I think it’s a good idea to invest directly in the business model when possible, but also know when it’s not.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How do you think about earning revenue off of your back catalog and/or a short-run series?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> This is where working with an ad agency and/or hosting your audio on a dynamic platform really helps. If you have the data to show that your back catalog is seeing discovery, that’s a great place to sell new campaigns &#8211; ideally, with the right technology, most ad campaigns you (or your agency) sell would be full-catalog, and then expire after a period of time or a set number of impressions/downloads have been reached. The exception here would be a presenting sponsor, which you might want to bake right into the audiofile and sell it as a “forever” ad.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do premiums work? Branded items? Goofy one-offs?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amira (glow.fm):</strong> Premiums work, and evidence demonstrates that premiums and bonus content earn higher on-average conversions than asks for listener support. Of course, this has to be balanced with the investment required to produce and offer premium content. On average, we’ve seen asks for listener support convert at about 1-2% and premium content convert 4-6% of listeners to paid.</li>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> We’ve seen mixed results. I’d say premiums are a “nice to have” if you have a highly engaged audience who wants to show off that they are part of the community, but we saw that they weren’t necessarily a major driver of donations. About half of the donors to season 2 of one of our highly-engaged audience podcasts selected a thank-you gift, which is aligned with what we see in terms of people taking thank-you gifts for on-air drives.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> We have had VERY mixed results with podcast premiums. Outside/In has been the most successful, mostly because the team has had a heavy hand in creating the premiums and made EXACTLY what they knew their audience might want (buffs, custom wooden pins, etc.) They also created content around their premiums (like <a href="https://twitter.com/OutsideInRadio/status/1115274044667043840?s=20">this cheeky video</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/outsideinradio/videos/385238945657414/">this cheeky video</a>). I think our station has also been afraid to do the kinds of premiums that would actually work for certain shows, because they aren’t traditional “public radio” &#8211; for instance, we had a brainstorm when we launched Stranglehold (which is very edgy) about creating merch or premiums featuring a quote from the podcast, “We don’t give a SH*T about Iowa!” I’m pretty sure listeners would have loved it, but it didn’t get off the ground here.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do you make paywalled content available to members who are already giving to the station (as opposed to the podcast)? Or do you treat them separately?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> We tried this as an experiment when we launched Patient Zero. I don’t see a downside to doing this at all. We did it as an opt-in, however, by sending current station sustainers an email with a button to push that would indicate they wanted the content. If they did so, they received an autoreply with instructions on how to get the content.</li>
</ul>
<h4>A comment &#8211; many public radio stations deploy a paywall strategy with pledge-free streams.</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> They sure do. This is a great “precedent” to lean on if you’re having a hard time selling the idea of early/exclusive content produced for donors.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Do listeners actually care about bonus (paywalled) or windowed content?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amira (glow.fm):</strong> Your biggest fans absolutely care. It might be a small subset of your listener base, but the people who love your podcast and can’t get enough of it will pay for more of it and pay early. Podcasts that offer extra content in exchange for payment often see higher conversion rates to paid.</li>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> Yes, bonus content can be a huge driver for those fans who just can’t get enough. It does take a lot of work from the production team, however, so you have to work closely to make sure you’re all on the same page before you embark on producing special episodes. There are lower lift ways of producing special content (mailbag episodes answering listener questions, extended interviews, for example) and then there are more produced bonus episodes like recording a live event and making it available in the bonus feed. We bundled our bonus feed for one of our podcasts into a “Starter Pack” with an enamel pin and poster that was really popular, along with many people opting for the bonus feed itself at the $20 donation level. Where we see challenges is the technical side of getting the feed into the user’s preferred podcast app, so that is something to consider.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> Heck yes they do. This is why Patreon is a thing. And you don’t need a lot of people to make a lot of money this way&#8230;for instance, my own (non-NHPR) show has only 1550 or so Patrons on Patreon, and while that may not seem like a lot of people to make additional content for, that number of people translates to $8,500 a month. Not bad, right?</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are there any partnerships between Patreon and public media that the panelists are aware of?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amira (glow.fm):</strong> I’m not aware of any, but glow.fm would be thrilled to chat about partnerships.</li>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> I’m not aware of any &#8211; we had looked into partnering with Glow.fm, but we are a university licensee so there are roadblocks to adding new payment processors and we couldn’t find workarounds in time for the podcast launch date.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> I haven’t seen any public radio shows using Patreon, but there are a small number of newsroom podcasts using it, including Accused from the Cincinnati Inquirer.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How do you blend donation ask with sponsor credits?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amira (glow.fm):</strong> The easiest approach is simply to stagger them. For example, you could have a donation ask in the preroll and offer sponsorship for midrolls. Having multiple asks in one show is normal and doesn’t necessarily dilute the impact of the asks. Another approach is to stagger by episode: one week you might ask for a donation, and the next one only allow sponsorships, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> Our traffic manager has created an inventory tracking system for podcasts just like we use for on-air promos, so that we can clearly track which messages are going out in preroll, midroll and postroll. We have not run into any major conflicts yet, and usually only include one message per placement. The production and marketing team also maintain a shared spreadsheet that keeps track of ALL calls to action in each break of every episode. This is important because they want to be sure that we have consistent and simple messaging. So for example, we want to avoid accidentally pairing a donation ask back-to-back with a “leave us a review” ask.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> We do a preroll for the ask, and do sponsor ads as midrolls &#8211; we’ve also used an ask as a midroll when there’s no ad booked.</li>
</ul>
<h4>A staple of on-air fundraising is matching gifts. Do matching gifts — be they from a major donor or foundation — amplify asynchronous giving on podcasts?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> We used a major donor match before the launch of Patient Zero to do a kickstarter-like “help us make this podcast” campaign. That worked okay-ish, but I don’t know how or if it would work on an actual podcast ask. I strongly believe podcast listeners see themselves as individuals supporting a thing they love, and that they don’t spend much time thinking about other supporters.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are underwriting departments bringing podcast Sponsorship revenue to the table?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> Our business support team is experimenting with overall podcast sponsorship as well as the traditional CPM model. The sponsorship package they are working on pitching includes preroll messages in all episodes, tags in on-air promo (promo and then sponsored by XYZ). There is a high price tag on this package because it involves broadcast and presence at any events held for the podcast, and is pitched along the idea of brand alignment/affinity just like for on-air revenue. This strategy is still in its infancy. We are also experimenting with selling preroll spots in podcast episodes of our on-air shows, which is having a slow start because our download numbers aren’t quite there. One big challenge is that many of our current business supporters are in the local area, and our most popular podcast, The Wild, has national reach. Our business support team has pointed out that willingness to collaborate in this space has been huge &#8211; we had one podcast host actually generate a list of businesses that may be good leads for sponsorship revenue because the host knew the audience and content so well, they knew what would best align to produce mutual benefit.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> Yes &#8211; we work with an agency to sell national ads, but our local underwriting team can also sell ads. The one challenge there has been working with that team on what podcasts ads should sound and feel like (not like public radio underwriting copy), and how to sell the value of them. I wish our sales team all listened to podcasts, but since they don’t, it’s hard for them to sell their value sometimes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Are there any examples of securing grant funding for podcasts?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> The only podcast we have received grant funding for is our RadioActive Youth Media podcast, which is a little different than the rest of our podcast content. We did receive a grant for an Emerging Platforms Producer, a position that does a tremendous amount of work on podcasts and smart speaker content. That’s who I work with regularly to evaluate donation data compared to listener/download data for our podcasts.</li>
<li><strong>Rebecca (NHPR):</strong> Yes, Civics 101 is supported by a big grant from the CPB, and we are pursuing other grant opportunities for that show and some of our other shows.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Can you share best and worst attempts at raising revenue? ($$$ amounts, conversion rates)</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Kjerstin (KUOW):</strong> Our best attempt so far was very low lift: our host asked for a dedicated donation form/link for them to share out, with one in-episode ask, that generated just under $6,000 in less than 60 days. We have not been able to replicate that success since, although I do think it was boosted during the calendar year-end fundraising period. Events have also helped generate revenue, we’ve held a few events related to podcasts and have seen success with including a suggested donation during the free RSVP process (ranging from $10-30), as well as using a DipJar system to quickly collect credit card donation in-person at the events. As far as worst attempts, we had one in-episode ask that sounded too much like the episode content itself, and it wasn’t clear to the listener that it was a separate ask from the content. We would have benefitted from a little more separation or maybe even having someone outside of the host team do the the ask.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Could you provide some examples of excellent independent podcasts who fundraise well?</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Amira (glow.fm):</strong> A best-in-class example of this is <a href="https://samharris.org/podcast/">Making Sense with Sam Harris</a>. Sam’s podcast is entirely listener supported. There’s no ad revenue, but at the beginning of every episode, he makes an extended call to action (sometimes as long as 10 minutes!) explaining why he doesn’t take ads and believes it’s important to create a listener supported show. He has an entire staff that now helps produce the show and manage his website, and 100% of his income is from various calls to action where people either support the show or pay for additional content.</li>
<li><strong>Amira (glow.fm)</strong> <strong>(continued):</strong> <a href="http://www.glow.fm/acquired">Acquired</a> is a mid-sized podcast about technology that has generated over $40,000 this year through offering premium content. They’re a small show, where both the hosts put it out in addition to their day jobs. But, they’re diligent about releasing both free and bonus episodes regularly, and work creatively to promote their premium content subscription program.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Thanks, everyone!</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is Part 4 of a <a href="/tag/affiliate-marketing/">series of blog posts</a> for WBUR BizLab’s Affiliate Marketing Project, funded by the <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/innovation-grants/">Lenfest Institute.</a>]</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While WBUR Guides did not turn a profit, the process of building the site and testing promotion methods revealed critical insights into the prospects for affiliate marketing within Public Media web properties. </span></p>
<h2>WBUR’s Future with Affiliate Marketing</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Should we make a similar effort again, we’d use Facebook ads only for testing content and for email acquisition. Also, we now know not to embark on such an effort without </span><b>securing a commitment to promote the content extensively where our regular readers and listeners are most engaged, which is on-air and on www.wbur.org.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At WBUR, we’ve seen steady year-over-year revenue growth from Amazon ever since we began inserting their affiliate links into our book articles in August of 2017:</span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WBURs-Amazon-Affiliate-Revenue-Year-over-Year.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1993 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WBURs-Amazon-Affiliate-Revenue-Year-over-Year.png" alt="" width="600" height="371" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WBURs-Amazon-Affiliate-Revenue-Year-over-Year.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WBURs-Amazon-Affiliate-Revenue-Year-over-Year-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon retail eCommerce sales in the US have shown consistent growth, and </span><a href="https://forecasts-na1.emarketer.com/5911eeb5aeb8830e3829e285/5b2c1abf81f26a0cacc016b2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eMarketer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> projects further growth in the future for Amazon and US eCommerce sales in general. Barring unpredictable macro-trends in the economy, we expect that </span><b>consistently applied affiliate links on existing content will expand revenue each year for the near-future.</b></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Amazon-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1995 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Amazon-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales.png" alt="" width="653" height="589" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Amazon-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales.png 1020w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Amazon-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales-300x271.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Amazon-Retail-Ecommerce-Sales-768x693.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The clean and transparent design of the guides site attracted praise from our underwriting department, so we may work with them to repurpose the design of WBUR Guides for sponsored content. Additionally, the data yielded from our more than 120 ad tests will be helpful in focusing how we pitch sponsored content to potential underwriters. Thanks to those tests, we know that our audience is interested in women’s shoes and sustainable home goods, and we know that the audience coming from www.wbur.org is more receptive to content that is closer to journalism in its style.</span></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Our Advice to Public Media Organizations</strong></h2>
<p>Following these tenets should help you prepare to engage in affiliate marketing at your organization and accurately measure  your audience&#8217;s reaction once you&#8217;re ready to promote it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Begin by promoting Amazon affiliate links.</strong> The variety of products from their site means you can promote almost anything, and see what has traction. When you&#8217;ve identified your niche, find a vendor in CJ which caters to that category and take advantage of CJ&#8217;s higher commission.</li>
<li><strong>Publish and test a variety of content, including different writing styles.</strong> The results may surprise you. Until we ran tests which proved otherwise, we&#8217;d expected vegetable delivery to outperform women&#8217;s shoes.</li>
<li><strong>Track everything.</strong> Track each step that your audience takes so you can understand where they&#8217;re hitting snags, and determine which audience is most likely to yield product-clicks.</li>
<li><strong>Organic Traffic is your most valuable asset.</strong> Work with your editorial team to integrate affiliate marketing content and promote affiliate content within your news site as much as is possible. The closer the affiliate content is to your core content the more your audience will embrace it.</li>
<li><strong>Facebook is great for testing, but using it simply to advertise your content is unlikely to produce a profit.</strong> You&#8217;ll always pay more for your audience than they yield in referral fees.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">[This is part 3 of a <a href="/tag/affiliate-marketing/">series of blog posts</a> for WBUR BizLab’s Affiliate Marketing Project, funded by the <a href="https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/innovation-grants/">Lenfest Institute</a>.]</span></i></p>
<p>As we approached the Affiliate Marketing project, <a href="/2019/08/exploring-the-potential-of-affiliate-marketing-the-strategy/">we established key performance indicators (KPIs)</a> to measure while testing, and to guide the refinement of our strategy. Both of our KPIs are based on product clicks from our product guides on <a href="https://guides.wbur.org/">WBUR Guides</a> to retailer websites. Once users leave our site we can’t track which of them convert to purchase, so product clicks are the limit of our ability to track users from acquisition through to conversion.</p>
<p>Our most important KPI for evaluating each promotional campaign is <strong>Product Click Rate</strong>. This allows us to judge varying audiences by indicating their relative likelihood to click one of our products.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Product Click Rate = Quantity of Product Clicks / Quantity of Users</em></p>
<p>When comparing paid campaigns, the most important KPI is <strong>Cost-per-Product-Click</strong>. This makes it easy to understand which of your paid campaigns is arriving at your desired end-result most cost-effectively.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost Per Product Click = $ Cost of Campaign / Quantity of Product Clicks</span></em></p>
<hr />
<h2><strong>Traffic to Guides and Earnings from Amazon and CJ Affiliates</strong></h2>
<p>Between site launch on May 23, 2019 and the close of the project July 31, 2019, more than <strong>39,000 users visited</strong> our site in over <strong>42,000 sessions.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That activity yielded <strong>$203.01</strong> in referral earnings from 111 purchases. (I’ll spare you the grisly details, but $203 is far less than we invested in Facebook ads.)</li>
<li>77% of user purchases came from Amazon, and the rest from individual retailers registered with CJ Affiliates.</li>
<li>Overall, we received a <strong>7.01% commission</strong> <strong>from our referred Amazon sales</strong>, and a <strong>12.76% commission from CJ</strong> Affiliates.</li>
<li><strong>72% of our Amazon sales were for indirect purchases</strong> &#8211; i.e. users clicked one of our links, then bought something else entirely.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 style="color: green;"><strong>Lesson: Begin with Amazon, then use CJ Affiliates</strong></h3>
<p>Our advice is to start out with Amazon and test a variety of product reviews your audience may appreciate. Measure their ROI with analytics, and monitor the products for which you’ve earned referral revenue. When you’ve found a niche, use CJ Affiliates to connect with advertisers who may be paying higher commissions than Amazon. Our reasoning is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon offers a greater variety of products which you can advertise, and you’ll earn revenue for any Amazon purchase made by your referred audience in the 24 hours after they clicked your referral link. That’s powerful when you consider that Amazon was responsible for <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2019/02/27/amazon-grabs-a-third-of-us-ecommerce-sales-in-2018/">33.7% of the eCommerce market in 2018</a>.</li>
<li>CJ Affiliates pays a higher commission but does not offer the above described advantage of cross-purchases. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Choosing the right niche will result in higher earnings from CJ, but reviewing unpopular niche products could lead to no revenue at all.</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><b>Most Successful Guide &amp; Product</b></h2>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FB-Ad-Shoes-27-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-1982 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FB-Ad-Shoes-27-1-e1565793907258.png" alt="" width="345" height="612" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FB-Ad-Shoes-27-1-e1565793907258.png 345w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/FB-Ad-Shoes-27-1-e1565793907258-169x300.png 169w" sizes="(max-width: 345px) 100vw, 345px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We published a total of 11 guides, covering 10 categories including sustainable home goods, women’s shoes, travel goods, fresh vegetable delivery, and reusable straws.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our audience was receptive &#8211; of the 120 users who answered our embedded survey, </span><b>87% said WBUR Guides are &#8220;useful,&#8221;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>82% want to see more Guides.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our guide to women’s shoes, </span><a href="https://guides.wbur.org/2019/05/09/the-six-most-comfortable-shoes-for-every-type-of-traveler/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Six Most Comfortable Shoes for Every Type of Traveler</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> proved to be the most popular:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We ran a Facebook ad sending users to our homepage where we list all our published articles and </span>71%<span style="font-weight: 400;"> of those who clicked on an article chose to visit the guide to women’s shoes, despite its position as ten out of eleven in the list.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our first run of Facebook ads tested fresh vegetable delivery, eyeglasses, women’s shoes, and children’s toys against each other, to determine which of our ads had the greatest appeal. Users who saw the ad for Women’s Shoes</span> <strong>clicked through at a 2.04%</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> rate</strong>, more than twice the click-through-rate of any other ad in the test.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above described ad series yielded three shoe purchases; no other guide produced such immediate and consistent results. In particular, one shoe, the </span><a href="https://www.thewalkingcompany.com/p/lemhi/3611-6010"><b>Born Lemhi</b></a>, <span style="font-weight: 400;">produced more click-throughs and revenue than any other single product we advertised. Testing the image of that pair against our other featured women’s shoes in a series of Facebook ads, it yielded an ad click-through-rate four times greater than the other shoe options.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color: green;"><b>Lesson: Publish and Test a Variety of Content</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Publish a variety of content and test it head-to-head using A/B testing. Find your niche by understanding which products attract an audience and then generate click-throughs and purchases. Before testing, we thought fresh vegetables and toys would perform better than women&#8217;s shoes!</span></p>
<h3 style="color: green;"><b>Lesson: Track Everything</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before you begin to promote your content, be sure that you are prepared to track your audience’s response. You’ll need:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Google Analytics</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Install this on your site to track your site’s overall usage and analyze your audience.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Google Tag Manager</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Connect GTM to Google Analytics to track important actions such as product clicks as goals in Google Analytics. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Google URL Builder</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Every time you distribute a link to your content as part of a campaign, use this tool to set up UTM parameters, including a unique campaign name for each link. When users click those links and arrive at your site, the parameters you added allow Google Analytics to attribute that traffic to your specified campaign.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When these tools are used together, you’ll be able to attribute each user and each product click to a campaign. That way, when you strike gold and a torrent of product clicks register, you’ll be able to understand which campaign sent those users and either repeat or refine your technique.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Advertising platforms like Facebook can tell you what it cost to acquire the users, but not whether those users converted to product clicks.</strong> When using these analytics tools to connect the cost of the campaign to the end result of product-clicks, you’ll get a clearer sense of ROI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, survey your affiliate marketing audience either through a marketing email or by embedding a survey on your site. Our survey collected ideas for further guides, and the overwhelmingly positive responses justified our effort to promote them on WBUR.org.</span></p>

<h2><b>Sources of Traffic</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the experiment, we promoted the site with <b>104 Facebook ads</b>, </span><b>16 banner variations on www.wbur.org</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>2 mentions within articles on www.wbur.org</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><b>6 tweets</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><b>1 marketing email.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We saw the best product click-through-rates for audiences originating from www.wbur.org and from our email list. Paid traffic originating from Facebook was far less likely to click on one of our suggested products &#8211; even our most successful Facebook ad could not compete with the results from organic traffic.</span></p>

<h2><b>Successful WBUR.org Affiliate Articles</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It has long been WBUR’s practice to use Amazon affiliate links when an editorial article makes reference to a book. These links appear in articles sharing lists of books, i.e. holiday gift guide or summer reading lists, as well as author interviews. This is an exception to the station&#8217;s overall guideline against posting affiliate marketing content on WBUR.org. </span></p>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p>While promoting WBUR Guides, WBUR/NPR’s On Point aired a show focused on summer reading and published a corresponding article with links to purchase the books at Amazon. The <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2019/07/15/2019-summer-books-reading-list">summer reading list article</a> yielded over $1,600 in Amazon referral fees, all from organic traffic. Once their organic traffic slackened, we ran a Facebook ad <span style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;">campaign promoting the summer reading list article.</span></p>
</div>

<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Orders-vs-Site-Traffic-1.png"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-1989 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Orders-vs-Site-Traffic-1.png" alt="" width="649" height="357" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Orders-vs-Site-Traffic-1.png 674w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Orders-vs-Site-Traffic-1-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The above chart follows the large number of orders (blue bars) as well as the page traffic for the summer reading list article (red line). The yellow line indicates the portion of that traffic sent from our paid Facebook ads. Our campaign successfully sent users to the article, but the visible gap in the chart between traffic and purchases indicates that users sent by Facebook ads were not as primed to make a purchase.  Before our campaign ran, </span><b>over 5%</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the page’s audience made an order, <strong>earning $.08 cents per user</strong>. During the period of our campaign,</span><b> that dropped to 1.5% or only $0.02 cents per user</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Earnings-vs.-Facebook-Ad-Spending.png"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1990 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Earnings-vs.-Facebook-Ad-Spending.png" alt="" width="600" height="371" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Earnings-vs.-Facebook-Ad-Spending.png 600w, /wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Summer-Reading-List_-Amazon-Earnings-vs.-Facebook-Ad-Spending-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This chart follows the </span><b>earnings generated by the article each day (green bars)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as the </span><b>amount we invested in Facebook ads each day of our three-day campaign (red bars)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Our campaign resulted in a somewhat anemic boost to earnings, and did not recoup the </span><b>$600</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> spent on promotion.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color: green;"><b>Lesson: Organic Traffic is Necessary to Produce a Profit</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your station’s organic web traffic is your most precious resource in Affiliate Marketing; this audience is already engaged with your content, and you’re more likely to hold their interest through to a product click. </span><b>Work with your editorial team to expose your content to the readers of your news site as much as is possible.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our case, we couldn’t treat our guides as if they were regular news articles on WBUR.org, but we managed to extract concessions like inserting links to guides into relevant articles as well as promoting the content with banners on WBUR.org.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You should expect push-back from your editorial team. Journalists may have an antipathy towards Affiliate Marketing in principle, as it departs from orthodox journalism standards. Get your foot in the door where you’re allowed and track your results, surveying your audience if possible. </span><b>If you can demonstrate that your content added value for the reader while earning income, you may have an easier time making your case for further affiliate marketing efforts.</b></p>
<h3 style="color: green;">Lesson: Facebook ads will not turn a profit for affiliate marketing</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll always pay more for your audience than can wring out of them in referral fees. Consider using it instead as a tool for testing content or to acquire email addresses. Our Facebook ads only worked during the period when they ran. If instead you can get the user’s email address, you may continue to market your affiliate content to them at no cost using an email newsletter.</span></p>
<hr />
<h2><b>Writing Style</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the project, we hired two contributors with distinct voices. We asked our first author, <a href="https://guides.wbur.org/author/rebecca-palermo/">Rebecca Palermo</a> to write product reviews from a personal perspective, while we asked our second author, <a href="https://guides.wbur.org/author/rachel-brandt/">Rachel Brandt</a> to used a more explanatory style which more closely resembled journalism. We asked them to each write an article about sustainable home goods, then measured our audience’s reaction to each style.</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Writing Style</th>
<th>Product CTR for WBUR Users from Banner Ads</th>
<th>Product CTR for Facebook Users from Paid Ads</th>
<th>Cost per Product Click for Facebook Users</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit;">Product reviews from a personal perspective</span></strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">1.80%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>7.90%</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$10.34</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Explanatory style, closer to a journalistic approach</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;"><strong>2.80%</strong></td>
<td style="text-align: center;">6.00%</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">$12.50</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our results indicated that users coming from Facebook ads were more engaged with the product review writing-style. Meanwhile, those coming from WBUR.org banner ads appeared to find the explanatory journalism-style content more engaging.</span></p>
<hr />
<h3 style="color: green;"><b>Lesson: Test Different Writing Styles</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Try different writing styles to see what is most effective at connecting with your users. Keep in mind that different acquisition methods may affect which content is most-appreciated by your users.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our case, our realization of the value of WBUR&#8217;s organic audience means that we’d stick with a writing style that looks and feels more like journalism, as it appears to capture the attention of that audience more effectively.</span></p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>WBUR&#8217;s<a href="https://www.wbur.org/ilab"> iLab</a> produces a variety of critically-acclaimed <a href="https://www.wbur.org/ilab">podcasts</a>, but we&#8217;ve never asked our podcast listeners for donations. Our traditional on-air pledge drives have been limited to the region covered by our radio towers. In contrast, our podcasts are downloaded by listeners from around in the world; asking these listeners for donations could provide a new revenue stream from an untapped, global audience.</p>
<p>We identified three challenges for this experiment, primarily stemming from the inherent difference in mediums between broadcast radio and podcast downloads.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Podcasts are on-demand, so we won&#8217;t have the traditional advantage of a captive radio audience.</strong> While a commuter may remain tuned in for the length of a radio donation ask, a podcast listener can advance the audio using the built-in &#8216;advance 15/30 seconds&#8217; buttons available in podcast apps.</li>
<li><strong>We&#8217;ve never asked for donations through a podcast before</strong>, meaning we&#8217;ll need to experiment to determine what messaging, donation amount, and premium offer are most effective at activating the audience and persuading them to follow through with their donation.</li>
<li><strong>Podcasts are primarily a mobile experience, and our standard <a href="https://secure.wbur.org/WebModule/Donate.aspx?P=WEBHEART&amp;PAGETYPE=PLG&amp;CHECK=GCTAxyrQxwe7mT9k6Yic623L5BYddGq6PVAl6UEf65g%3d">donation form</a> is not what mobile users have come to expect </strong>from payment processors. It asks potential donors to fill in far too many fields on their cell phone keyboard, and a lot of those fields are not necessary to process a donation or identify the donor. To make it as easy as possible for mobile donors to give, we need to make this a more seamless experience by taking advantage of mobile payment processing technologies.</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">First Experiment: Circle Round &#8211; Coloring Book</span></h2>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wbur.org/circleround">Circle Round</a> is a storytelling podcast aimed at young children and families. For our first experiment, <strong>we offered a pledge gift of a Circle Round coloring book in return for a donation of $5 per month or $60 for a year.</strong> The coloring book tied into episodes so children could color along while listening. However, this value was not effectively demonstrated by our donation page &#8211; there was no way to view the coloring book at this point in the process.</p>
<p>In this experiment, we placed the call-to-action in the podcast&#8217;s midroll. Listen to an example of our Circle Round coloring book mid-roll:</p>

<li><strong>Effective Conversion Rate</strong> (downloads to successful gifts): <strong>0.02% </strong>(52 users donated out of 262,260 downloads)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second Experiment: Endless Thread &#8211; Six-Second Song</span></h2>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.wbur.org/endlessthread">Endless Thread</a> explores stories found in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a> threads and interviews the people involved, as well as experts on the subject. <strong>We offered a customized 6-second song written and recorded by the hosts in return for a $10 donation.</strong> We went this low in our ask amount in an attempt to make this an ‘impulse purchase’ and get a larger portion of the audience interested. Instead of relying only on a web donation form, we used a text-to-donate platform, with a web form as a fallback. Successful donors were routed to a form that collected their information and preferences for their custom song. As we approached the end of the campaign, we updated the pre-roll to enhance the urgency of the request, and to provide examples of the six-second songs.</p>
<p>We placed the call-to-action in the preroll and varied it week-by-week. Listen to an example of an Endless Thread pre-roll, including a six-second song:</p>
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-1671-2" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/02-EndlessThread-Donation-PRE3.mp3?_=2" /><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/02-EndlessThread-Donation-PRE3.mp3">/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/02-EndlessThread-Donation-PRE3.mp3</a></audio>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activation Rate </strong>(downloads to attempted gifts): <strong>0.11% </strong>(471 users activated out of 433,447 downloads)</li>
<li><strong>Conversion Rate</strong> (attempted to successful gifts): <strong>49.47% </strong>(233 users donated out of 471 users activated)</li>
<li><strong>Effective Conversion Rate</strong> (downloads to successful gifts): <strong>0.05% </strong>(233 users donated out of 433,447 downloads)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Experiment: Circle Round &#8211; Summer Camp Sweepstakes</span></h2>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>The text-to-donate tool used in the second experiment showed a high failure rate, so we wanted to try an alternative mobile payment system called <a href="https://www.givelively.org/">Give Lively</a>. This tool allows non-profits to quickly create mobile-friendly fundraising pages. Critically, it also functions with Apple Pay or Google Pay, largely eliminating the cumbersome process of filling out those fields with a mobile device&#8217;s keyboard. Give Lively doesn&#8217;t use the donor&#8217;s cell phone bill to process the payments, a significant advantage because it eliminates issues around cell phone providers declining donation attempts.</p>
<p>We conducted a third experiment, again using the Circle Round podcast audience. This time, we offered entrance to a summer camp sweepstakes in return for a $25 donation made using our Give Lively-powered <a href="https://secure.givelively.org/donate/trustees-of-boston-university/circle-round-camp-birch-hill-sweepstakes">donation page</a>.</p>
<p>Initially, we did not feature the voice of the host in the pre or mid-roll noting the sweepstakes, and very few users were activated to visit the page, let alone donate. Activation and conversion rates improved when we added a host message as a mid-roll. Another factor is that the sweepstakes offer had numerous eligibility restrictions, including the requirement that a winning camper be between the ages of 8 and 11.</p>
<p>Listen to an example of a Circle Round sweepstakes creative mid-roll, before we added audio in the host&#8217;s voice:</p>
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-1671-3" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/wav" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Circle-Round-Birch-Hill-Midroll-v02.wav?_=3" /><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Circle-Round-Birch-Hill-Midroll-v02.wav">/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Circle-Round-Birch-Hill-Midroll-v02.wav</a></audio>
<p>&#8230;and after we added a message from the host; this addition improved our activation and conversion rates for the campaign:</p>
<audio class="wp-audio-shortcode" id="audio-1671-4" preload="none" style="width: 100%;" controls="controls"><source type="audio/mpeg" src="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CR-CAMPMID-Version3.mp3?_=4" /><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CR-CAMPMID-Version3.mp3">/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/CR-CAMPMID-Version3.mp3</a></audio>
<h3>Metrics</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activation Rate</strong> (downloads to attempted gifts): <strong>0.07% </strong>(375 users activated out of 504,460 downloads)</li>
<li><strong>Conversion Rate</strong> (attempted to successful gifts): <strong>8.00% </strong>(30 users donated out of 375 users activated)</li>
<li><strong>Effective Conversion Rate</strong> (downloads to successful gifts): <strong>0.01% </strong>(30 users donated out of 504,460 downloads)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusions</span></h2>
<h3>Payment Methods</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our conversion rate suffered when we relied on the traditional donation form</strong> in the first experiment. <strong>Compare its 11.5% conversion-rate to the 49.47% we achieved in the second experiment by adding text-to-donate.</strong>
<ul>
<li>This likely a result of a) the cumbersome mobile experience offered by our traditional donation form and b) the absence of a coloring book image on the donation form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Text-to-donate platforms that charge to donor&#8217;s cell phone bills is not an ideal solution</strong>; 55% of attempts failed. 13% was due to technical failure (the donor&#8217;s cell phone bill would not accept the charge) and the remaining 42% did not send a second text to confirm their donation. Additionally, with these platforms <strong>we are not permitted to re-market to contacts acquired through text-to-donate</strong>, and recurring donations are not an option.</li>
<li>Give Lively did not offer the marked improvement in the conversion rate that we&#8217;d been hoping for. However, we attribute that to the low level of interest in the sweepstakes offer. We plan to try this tool again with a more broadly appealing offer.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Donation Amounts</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>We recommend asking for at least $20 for a one-time donation or at least $5 for a per-month donation.</strong> Lowering our ask for Endless Thread to $10 for the six-second song did give us the impulse purchase volume we&#8217;d expected, but our avid listeners voluntarily donated more, averaging $20.
<ul>
<li>The Endless Thread donors who used the web form could choose their donation amounts. When users made their donation via the web form, <strong>25% chose to donate more than the suggested $10</strong>; one even donated $100.  This suggests <strong>we could have easily doubled the Endless Thread ask to $20</strong> without losing many donors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Donation Messaging</h3>
<ul>
<li>The audio clips where we made our asks were quite short, and we&#8217;ve begun to hear success stories indicating that <strong>a longer ask is more effective at activating the listeners.</strong></li>
