										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To maintain journalistic integrity, most public radio stations have rigid boundaries between newsrooms and fundraising departments. The public media </span><a href="http://www.codeofintegrity.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Code of Integrity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> states that media organizations will: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Protect the editorial process from the fact and appearance of undue influence, exercising care in seeking and accepting funds and setting careful boundaries between contributors and content creators. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In BizLab’s work with our cohort stations this year, we have invested a great deal of time in helping stations navigate these boundaries while acknowledging the importance of diversifying revenue streams in the digital age. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three of BizLab’s cohort stations have practical experience in navigating these boundaries as they implemented their revenue generation idea. All three found ways to successfully collaborate and leverage shared goals to the benefit of the station. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Join us on November 12th to hear a panel discussion, with question and discussion time at the end. BizLab’s Experience Strategist, Sarah Bloomer, will facilitate. </span></p>
<h2>Date</h2>
<p>Tuesday, November 12, 2019, 3-4pm Eastern Time</p>
<h2>Speakers</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Meta Stange</em>, Digital Producer for WDET, also runs the station’s social channels and creates digital editorial content for wdet.org. Meta will talk about using social media to enable small businesses in Detroit to reach the WDET audience while staying within station guidelines and remaining true to their brand., . </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Brendan Kinney</em>, Senior Vice President for Marketing and Development at Vermont Public Radio, will share how they are working with their  journalist who covers the region of southern Vermont, giving him greater exposure and connection to the local community. </span></p>

<p>Is your nonprofit news organization reliant on donations and underwriting? BizLab&#8217;s July webinar presents three alternative ways of generating revenue at nonprofit news organizations:</p>
<p><strong>The VTDigger</strong> (<a href="http://vtdigger.org/">http://vtdigger.org/</a>), as a service to Vermont businesses, <strong>post press releases from businesses, state agencies, political organizations and nonprofits.</strong>  They have been expanding the services connected with press releases to explore if there are revenue opportunities for VTDigger. During the webinar, <strong>Founder and Editor Anne Galloway</strong> will share results from this experiment.</p>
<p><strong>WLRN&#8217;s Cultural Connection</strong> (<a href="https://www.culturalconnection.org/">https://www.culturalconnection.org/</a>) is a long running service provided to South Florida, connecting theatre venues with customer&#8217;s looking for <strong>last-minute ticket discounts</strong>. And this primarily digital service generates significant revenue for WLRN. <strong>Brendan Glynn, Director of Corporate Underwriting at Friends of WLRN, Inc.</strong>, will share the history of how this service was established and how the station manages the business.</p>
<p><strong>WBUR&#8217;s BizLab</strong> is exploring <strong>affiliate marketing</strong> as a revenue source for the station. With outside contributors writing product recommendation &#8220;guides,&#8221; WBUR launched a site called WBUR Guides (<a href="http://guides.wbur.org/">http://guides.wbur.org/</a>) that highlights interesting products on the market geared for the public radio audience. By testing and iterating, we are learning what works in terms of topics, products, distribution, and promotion. <strong>Matt Aufiero, BizLab 2019 Fellow,</strong> will share results.</p>
